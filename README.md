Designer, Dreamer, Realizer. Designing the future through technology.

Hi, I'm Ardie. I'm an enthusiast and highly interested in Product Design (UX and UI), and I believe in design as a bridge to solve human problems. I strongly believe in human-centered design that's compelling and purposeful. I have a great understanding of Product Design, Technology, and Business that goes functional, measurable, and reliable.

I'm a designer with a background in engineering; hence I can think systematically and in an abstract or high-level view. I also like to map plans and set clear goals in advance to find the best decision and spend my time most effectively.

I believe that every time problem arises, there will also be solutions.

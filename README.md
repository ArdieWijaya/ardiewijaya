Hello everyone! I am half a designer & half a developer. Passionate about designing & developing products that make a meaningful impact on people's lives.

I have experience making digital products (web & mobile), previously working as a UI/UX Designer and currently as a Product Manager. I translate problems into requirements and solutions. Like to think critically, strategically, efficiently, and based on facts. 

I enjoy coding from time to time. I like to learn and try new things. I am seeking new opportunities and roles relating to web development to improve my knowledge and expand my network.

Hello everyone! I am half a developer & half a designer. Passionate about designing & developing products that make a meaningful impact on people's lives.

I have experience making digital products (web & mobile), previously working as a UI/UX Designer, Product Manager, and currently as a Backend Developer. I translate problems into requirements and solutions. Like to think critically, strategically, efficiently, and based on facts. 

I enjoy coding from time to time. I like to learn and try new things. I am seeking new opportunities and roles relating to web development to improve my knowledge and expand my network. Striving to learn and deliver high-quality, scalable, predictable, and high-performance web applications with great user experience.

----------

ps: I am also interested in finance, capital market, and economics.
